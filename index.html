                        I am a student at the <a href="https://ecolesaintlaurent.ca/">École Secondaire Saint-Laurent</a>. I often like to try new things to do just like right now, which is developping my first website. I like to enroll myself in multiple departments so that I can get the most out of my highschool life. Making projects like these will help with my general knowledge and real life work too.
